30 Days of Google Cloud program will provide you an opportunity to kickstart your career in cloud and get hands-on practice on Google Cloud Platform - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

Along the way, you will learn & practice concepts like computing, application development, big data & machine learning using cloud & if you get stuck, you will have your "Campus Facilitators" who are specially trained on Google Cloud to help. ðŸ˜Ž

# Program's Syllabus
The program will introduce you to Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud's training platform called Qwiklabs where you will learn each of these topic using self-paced labs that provides you temporary credentials to Google Cloud Platform, so you can learn the cloud using the real thing â€“ no simulations.

For convinience, we have divided the topics above into 2 different tracks - Cloud Engineering Track and Data Science & Machine Learning Track.
